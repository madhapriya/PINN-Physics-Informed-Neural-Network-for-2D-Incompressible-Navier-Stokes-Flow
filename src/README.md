# Physics-Informed Neural Network for 2D Navier–Stokes Flow

This project reproduces a benchmark Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
for solving 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.

The implementation follows a reference open-source model and focuses on
understanding the integration of physical laws into deep learning.

Due to computational and licensing constraints, reference-trained weights
and reported results are used for analysis and visualization.


Note:
Local execution was limited due to MATLAB license constraints.
Reference benchmark results are reported from the original implmentation
